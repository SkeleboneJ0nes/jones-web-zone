        <td>Race past the opposition and try for a hi-scoring distance! Hi score stored between play sessions, so you can always keep track of your best score. Avoid driving off the road or bumping into other racers, or you will lose health!</td>
        <td>This was a technically advanced and well-polished project submitted by 7th graders in 4th quarter (2024). Carter K. is responsible for the majority of the coding on this project, and it's clear to see he put a lot of effort into it! His group members Roman K. and Nikko C. helped with planning. I find it very impressive that they were able to create a working hi score system.</td>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> - great tool for learning to program and playing cool games made by other people. V inspiring</li>
            <li><a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> - A website where lots of indie devs upload their games. I have a couple really old Game Jam games that you could hypothetically play here. They are not good lol</li>
            <li><a href="/p5playtest.html">My Test Project</a> - I'm experimenting with a physics-based javascript game engine called p5play. It can do a lot more than MakeCode Arcade, but it's much much harder to use. If you want to learn how to use it, you can join my secret class section <a href="https://codehs.com/go/E6C8B">here</a></li>
            <li><a href="/basiclife">Conway's Game of Life</a> - for my first Flex Friday session at Innovation Academy, I taught students how to program their own simple life simulation. See the link for a working example! Or <a href="/gameoflife">here</a> for an advanced version :) </li>
