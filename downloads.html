                <td>Godot website has been intermittently blocked on school networks - you can access the file here. Godot is a game engine similar to Unity that is currently exploding in popularity. It can be downloaded without admin permission on school devices and runs much better that Unity, including on low end devices. It's better for 2d development than Unity, but generally considered a bit worse for 3d (though it is still completely capable and improving quickly).</td>

I've included the link to their downloads page here because Windows computers like to forcefully take you to the Windows store download page, which blocks you from downloading it on school networks.
